## Architecture
The application is divided into two main components:  

- **Client:** The frontend, built with React and TypeScript, handles the user interface and communicates with the backend via APIs.  

- **Server:** The backend, developed in Java with Spring Boot, follows a **hexagonal architecture**. This design ensures a clean separation between the business logic and external systems (e.g., database, API clients), making the application modular, maintainable, and easy to test.

## Setup
To run the application, follow these steps:

- **Configuration file**:  
   Make sure you have a proper `.env` file located in the `client` folder.

- **Docker**:  
   Start the necessary services using Docker. Run the following command in the project root directory: `docker compose up -d`

- **Client**:  
   Navigate to the `client` folder and run the following commands:  
   - `npm install` to install the required dependencies.  
   - `npm run dev` to start the development server.  
   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

- **Server**:  
   Navigate to the `server` folder and run the application using your IDE or the following command: `./gradlew bootRun`  
   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.
